Major changes in 0.5.2:
=======================

This is the first release of the unstable 0.5.x series leading up to 0.6.
With this release the API of spice-server is considered stable, but
the network protocol and QXL PCI ABI are still unstable.

The major changes compared to the 0.4 series are:

* New, more efficient network protocol
* Support for offscreen surfaces in guest driver
* New spice-server API
* A marshalling/demarshalling system that isolates the network
  protocol parsing from the internal types
* A PCI parsing and validation layer making it easier to
  get backwards compatibility, cleaning up the internals ans
  makes security review easier.
* WAN support, including lossy compression using jpeg and
  zlib compression.
* Easier to build. No more dependencies on forked versions
  of pixman and cairo. Separate module spice-protocol containing
  headers used when building drivers and qemu.
