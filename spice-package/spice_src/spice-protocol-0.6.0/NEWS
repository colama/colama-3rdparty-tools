Major changes in 0.6.0:
=======================
* Initial messages for clipboard sharing
* Move agent protocol structs from spice to spice-protocol
* Add capabilities to agent protocol

Major changes in 0.5.3:
=======================

Network major number changed to 2 to reflect that the network
protocol is now stable and backwards compatible from this point.

Some vdagent messages for display settings and clipboard sharing
were added.

Major changes in 0.5.2:
=======================

This is the first release of the unstable 0.5.x series leading up to 0.6.
This module was split out of spice so that e.g. drivers and qemu can
get the types and constants they need without using the full spice
codebase.
